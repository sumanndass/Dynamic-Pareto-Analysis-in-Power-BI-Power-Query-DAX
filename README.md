### Project Overview
Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) is a common analytical technique, but most implementations are static.

- This project demonstrates how to build a fully dynamic Pareto dashboard in Power BI that allows users to:
  - Switch analysis between Customer / Product / Supplier
  - Switch metrics between Revenue / Complaints / Delivery Delay
  - Dynamically adjust the Pareto threshold (48%–53%)
  - Automatically highlight the critical contributors
  - All calculations are measure-driven, not column-based.
